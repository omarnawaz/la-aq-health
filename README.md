# la-aq-health

This repository currently only includes a single file: la_aq_health_v1.ipynb. This jupyter notebook serves as a tutorial on how to create an interactive app using adjoint sensitivites of three pollutants (PM2.5, O3, and NO2) to their precursor species. We combine these sensitivities with emissions data from the US EPA's NEI for base year 2011.
